# wind-energy-fuzzy-control
Wind energy has gained an increasing worldwide interest due to the continuous increase in fuel cost and the need to have a clean source of energy. The main objective of most of the wind energy systems is to extract the maximum power available in the wind stream. However, the wind regime varies continuously and thus the system controllers should be updated to follow these variations. This paper is intended to apply fuzzy logic control techniques to overcome the effect of the wind speed variations on the parameters of the wind turbines and their controllers
